## Why Markdown?

Every content editing tool has its tradeoffs. Markdown offers semantic formatting which reflects on the HTML document structure.

## Type-Safe code

Using TypeScript compiler that transforms the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript helps to write JavaScript better by bringing type safety to your code. <br />

Contentlayer generates type definitions for the transformed content. It validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data you can easily import into your application.
